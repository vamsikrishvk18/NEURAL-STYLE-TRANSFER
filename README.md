##DESCRIPTION-The Neural Style Transfer task involves creating a new image by combining the content of one image with the artistic style of another. This is achieved using a deep learning model, specifically a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) like VGG-19. In this task, the user uploads two images: a content image that provides the structure or layout, and a style image that provides the artistic texture, color, and patterns. The system then processes both images and generates a new image that looks like the content image painted in the style of the style image. The process involves calculating content and style losses and using optimization techniques to update the generated image. This project helps in understanding how neural networks can be used creatively in art generation and image transformation. It is commonly used in applications such as artistic filters, digital design, and AI-generated artwork.
